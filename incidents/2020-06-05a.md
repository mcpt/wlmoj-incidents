# Incident 2020-06-05a ![`status: identified`](/status-badges/identified.svg)

## Issue Summary
Mathoid, texoid, and the event server ceased to function. This left certain users seeing raw latex instead of rendered text, and left all of the texoid diagrams as raw text.

## Timeline (Eastern Time)
- `2020-06-05 02:11` Issue first identified.
- `2020-06-05 12:46` First attempt at resolution made.
- `2020-06-11 19:57` Texoid functionality restored.
- `2020-06-11 20:11` Mathoid functionality restored.

## Root Cause
Unknown.

## Resolution and recovery
During the first attempt made mathoid and texoid were found in a stopped state. Both services were restarted with `docker start <id>`. This did not resolve the issue.

After further inspection of the setup, mathoid and texoid were not explicitly set up in `local_settings.py`. The following configuration was added (note the port for mathoid is not 8888 as it is in the dmoj documentation):
```python
#############
## Mathoid ##
#############
MATHOID_URL = 'http://localhost:10044'
MATHOID_CACHE_ROOT = '/code/cache/mathoid'
MATHOID_CACHE_URL = '//mcpt.ca/mathoid/'

############
## Texoid ##
############
TEXOID_URL = 'http://localhost:8888'
TEXOID_CACHE_ROOT = '/code/cache/texoid'
TEXOID_CACHE_URL = '//mcpt.ca/texoid/'
```
Mathoid, texoid, and the site were restarted and their functionality was restored.


## Corrective and Preventative Measures
None.
